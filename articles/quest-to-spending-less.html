                <h3>If you know me, you are aware of the countless hobbies I seem to randomly- and sporadically- take up in a very public manner. If you don't know me, You would be 
                    pleased to know that I absolutely love showing my latest project with everyone who has ears or eyes, either works. I began painting at a very young age, which in itself can
                    become quite expensive. I have found that one expensive hobby is not too hard to manage. Painting supplies last so they become investments when spending, and the most costly
                    expense then becomes the canvas, which honestly is not too bad. If working on a canvas that is a consistent size, you can buy from a supplier in packs of at least three, if not,
                    a nice large canvas can be around $50-$100 depending on where you buy it. Then alright, you make an investment and buy decent paints and brushes, plus cleaning supplies and rags, 
                    etc.. you only have to consistently buy $20-$100 per project depending on size. Maitanence of this hobby is the buying a single color or two of paint, or a size of brush.

                    However, lord knew I can make anything expensive. Picture this, the year is 2020, everyone is at home because of COVID, and what does everyone on the face of the planet do? Pick up a new hobby.
                    I did not decide to continue painting because at the time I was scared of oil paints, and started to hate acrylic paint, so I decided to take up sewing. I was gifted a sewing machine
                    for my 19th birthday, and boom. There then explodes a new expensive hobby. Similar to painting, sewing's biggest expenses are typically investments such as a sewing machine, seam rippers,
                    etc. Unlike painting though, unless you have a great printer, a crazy amount of space and time, and are talented in sewing, each project can run you up a pretty penny.
                    This is because in order to sew clothing, or intricate items, you might need a pattern. Patterns can be printed from a pdf which are sometimes free online and run cheaper than preprinted ones. 
                    The process to print these patterns is insane. It might be my lack of know how or talent, but it eats up such a big chunk of time. Preprinted patterns typically run at about 
                    $20. Thats not too bad, but these patterns requires fabric. You can buy fabric at thriftstores, but if you have a specific idea in mind or cannot find the right amount of fabric, basic cotton is cheap at about
                    $5/yard. The price changes depending on patterns, quality of cotton, if it is a different fabric material it is way more costly at around $7-9/yard. This also does not include buttons, zippers, and add ons
                    that may be needed. This brings the total to about $50-$80 per project. 
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    Okay, so you are probably thinking thats not too different from painting! In the end you even get clothes from sewing. I will tell you now I have been sewing on and off for so long and only
                    this past Thanksgiving have I been able to sew clothing I an even wear. The learning curve for sewing was not pretty for me at all. Please do not let this discourage you. Also, the clothing you make will be
                    drastically lower quality in at least structure than clothing you buy at a store. You are paying high-end prices for clothing that isnt even real yet and you have to put together. Now, I love sewing,
                    please do not get me wrong. I love sewing historical clothing and stores do not sell that clothing anymore. I also love being able to choose a fabric, buttons, and how well it fits me. It is really great.

                <h3>
                    Anyway, this is all to say I get bored of my projects fast and try to finish them in a week's time. Surprisingly, I finish projects that fast if I have willpower to do it and have enough energy to do another pattern,
                    and another, and another. But then I get tired of sewing and go back to painting for one week, or any of my other hobbies such as baking, gardening, embroidery, I just picked up beading, and frankly this blog is yet another
                    hobby I would like to pick up.
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    So, frankly, I cannot afford to spend up to $100 a week on my hobbies. Especially when there are times I do not finish the project before losing the alloted time of interest. So, what the heck do I do now knowing I do not have the 
                    extra time to start and finish a new project? Well, thats what I'm trying to figure out. Here is what is working for me so far.
                </h3>
                <h2>
                    What do I have at home?
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    Asking myself this question has stopped my spending for about a month now. If you have a computer, trust me that you can cut spending. In the past month I have picked up old hobbies like 3D modeling on blender, building architecture on
                    the Sims 4 (yes a real hobby I refuse to be told otherwise...), and fashion design! For the fashion design, I love creating eccentric costumes and typically I draw it. However, I started pattern making
                    on CLO3D (which is $25/month for students) which is seriously the coolest application I have been used. I have also taken up baking, but because I am trying to not eat so much sweets I've been baking bread, cornbread, etc. I know to some people it is not much better to bake
                    bread instead, but I can eat a whole cheesecake if its delicious enough, but I won't be doing that for bread. So, I take my wins and losses.
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    So there you have it. If you have a computer, you have a tool and can definitely find something to do that isn't scrolling endlessly on social media. Absolutely nothing against social media in moderation though. Most of my
                    hobbies were introduced to me through social media and I gain a lot of inspiration for projects on it.
                </h3>

                    Anyway, be happy, live life, and save money if you'd like to. See you later!
